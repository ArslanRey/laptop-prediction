# Prediction of Laptop PricesThe goal of this project was predicting the prices of laptops based on features, like:- which Company the laptop is from- Product(name) of the laptop- TypeName (e.g. UltraBook, Notebook ...)- Inches- ScreenResolution- Cpu- Ram (e.g. 4Gb, 8GB ...)- Memory- Gpu- Operating System (the column name in the csv is *OpSys*) and- the Weight of the laptop.The laptops dataset is from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ionaskel/laptop-prices).### Description of Plots- *heatmap_laptops_corr.png*: shows with a heatmap, how all features correlate with each other and how the features correlate with the laptop prices- *Plot_Laptop_Prices_all.png*: plot with the original laptops data- *Plot_Laptop_Prices_predicted-prices.png*: plot of the original data with the prices being calculated by the y-line of the linear model- *Plot_Laptop_Prices_with-best-fit-line.png*: original data with the best-fit-line on top### Tableau WorkbookTableau was used for data analysis. And for visualizing the correlation between the features and the laptop price. A more detailed description is following...## ResultsThe highest R^2-value in this laptop-prices-prediciton project after 25 Iterations is 0.56. The R^2 value could be increased by decreasing the sum of squared residuals. A decrease in the sum of the squared residuals wouldn't result in a straight line, as seen in the following figure:|![Figure](https://github.com/ArslanRey/laptop-prediction/blob/master/linear-regression/Plot_Laptop_Prices_with-best-fit-line.png)||:--:||*Figure showing the distribution the laptop-datapoints.*|But would lead into using a different Regression Model than LinearRegression (of scikit-learn) and to a more curved line.Continued...
